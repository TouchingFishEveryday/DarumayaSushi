            <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>

                <li><span class="year">1912</span>Born<span class="detail">Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23, 1912 in Maida Vale, London.</span></li>
                <li><span class="year">1926</span>Early Signs of Intelligence<span class="detail">At the age of 13, Alan Turing first showed signs of intelligence and potential which was noticed at the Sherborne School.</span></li>
                <li><span class="year">1931</span>Getting Serious About Technology<span class="detail">Alan Turing studied from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, in Cambridge. He was first in his class and was an honor student in the field of mathematics.</span></li>
                <li><span class="year">1936</span>Studied at Princeton University<span class="detail">Turing studied mathematics and cryptology while also building three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier at Princeton University.</span></li>
                <li><span class="year">1939</span>Hut 8<span class="detail">Turing helped to solve the essential part of the German naval indicator system and also came up with the idea of sequential analysis.</span></li>
                <li><span class="year">1940</span>Bombe<span class="detail">Turing was responsible for creating the Bombe which was a cryptanalytic machine used to decrypt the Enigma-enciphered messages being sent from the enemies.</span></li>
                <li><span class="year">1942</span>Travel to US<span class="detail">Turing traveled to the United States to work with the US naval cryptanalysts to create their version of the Bombe and an Enigma in Washington.</span></li>
                <li><span class="year">1946</span>Presented Paper<span class="detail">He presented his paper in February of 1946 where he had presented the first detailed design of a stored program computer setup.</span></li>
                <li><span class="year">1947</span>ACE<span class="detail">Turing lived in Hampton, London where worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine).</span></li>
                <li><span class="year">1948</span>LU decomposition method<span class="detail">Turing created the LU decomposition method that was used and is still used today to solve matrix equations.</span></li>
                <li><span class="year">1948</span>Software for stored-program computers<span class="detail">Turing was appointed a position in the mathematics department at the University of Manchester where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers.</span></li>
                <li><span class="year">1950</span>Turing Test<span class="detail">The turing test was created in 1950. The turing test was created to compare the intelligence of a machine/computer to the intelligence of a human brain.</span></li>
                <li><span class="year">1952</span>Book Published<span class="detail">Turing's book "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" was published in 1952 which was all about his interest in the biology of organisms.</span></li>
                <li><span class="year">1952</span>Indecency<span class="detail">Turing was caught in a relationship with an unemployed 19 year old man.
